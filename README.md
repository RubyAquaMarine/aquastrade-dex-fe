# todo 
- WalletConnect : network switching
- test coinbase wallet 
- `ledger wagmi connector` is trying to use walletConnect v1 
- support chainid 1 etherscan explorer 
- - need api key : https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/creating-an-account
- - defaults to `EuropaHub` if user not connected
- header with navigation and connect button -> connect button triggers popup -> popup includes the wagmin connection button selection
- powered by Skale needs to link to the correct block explorer (if connected else link to skale.space)
- support for nfts type ERC-721 (name, symbol, data doesn't exist: what else can we show for nft?)
- - list what number , token.id ? 

- Squid Router - https://github.com/0xsquid/widget-integrations/tree/main/packages/next-app#install-the-widget

## bugs 
- removed coinbase and ledger due to wss connection to `walletConnect.com` repeated errors , look into v1 or v2 is being used
- - https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/issues/1686 && https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src
-- rubyexchange widget needs to prompt user to switch network to europaHub 

possible fix: enabling CSP's connect-src to * on the page where I struggled to open the WalletConnect modal.
